# Music-Recommender

By: Esha Somavarapu and Sam Shrestha

Motivation

There are many apps and web services , such as Spotify, Pandora, and YouTube Red, for music-lovers to subscribe to listen to their favorite music, but because users of these services rarely rate the songs they listen to, developing a good recommendation system for such apps is quite a challenge. As avid music-listeners, we decided to bring together our love for music and our desire to learn more about big data technologies, and attempt to develop a music recommendation system. 

Project Description

Using Apache Spark, Python, Jupyter notebook, and Amazon AWS, we developed a  music recommendation system that analyzes how many times different songs were played by different users and makes a prediction of what new songs the users are likely to listen to.
